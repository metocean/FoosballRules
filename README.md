# FoosballRules

Player A and Player B play one game.
Then they swap places, and play until one player got more points than the other play did, on that side.

Example:
Troy as Red plays against RafS as Blue
When Troy gets 7 points by the time RafS has gotten 10 points.
Troy then plays as Blue, and RafS plays as Red.
Now Troy needs to get 10. But RafS only needs to get 7 (for a draw), and 8, for the win of the whole set.

So there are always two games in a set.

This allows players to play on both sides, which fixes any potential side-advantage that happens with tilt, dust, sun, noise, etc.



If the ball goes into the goal and then comes out back onto the table, that is not a point, the game is still in play.

The ball may be hit by the table-men while it is in the air, that is ok.

If the ball gets stuck behind a pair of defenders, the defending player may move the ball with his/her fingers to get control of the ball.
However, if the ball gets stuck anywhere else, it is to be re-served by the player who last served.

Have fun and do cool stuff

No spinning, this is because it damages the table.
